This folder contains articles about network adjustment.


* `Thanassoulasetal[1987]-simple method gravity base net adjust.pdf`: discusses a simple
method for correcting gravity intervals by minimizing the closing errors of closed loops.

* `Hwangetal[2002]-weighted and datum-free constraints relative gravity adjustment.pdf`:
discusses the methodology of adjustments of relative gravity data using different
mathematical models: 1) weighted; 2) datum-free constraints models. The least-squares
step by step discussion gives a better explanation than Escobar 1985.

* `Reports folder`: contains all the written annually reports submitted to the 
post-graduation evaluation

* `Seminars folder`: contains all files related to the presentation on the annually
