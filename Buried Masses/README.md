* `Balmino1972-earth potential by buried masses.pdf`: discusses the methodology of buried
masses which is a set of point masses obtained through the inversion of the spherical
harmonics expressions of the gravitational potential or gravity anomalies weighted
accordingly to their heights referred to a chosen observation surface.
